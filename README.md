## Hello World!

I am Mike Miller, a full-stack web developer and musician based in Woodbury, Minnesota. Having graduated from the University of Minnesota's Coding Bootcamp through Trilogy Education Services, I am excited to find ways to utilize my passion for coding.

With a strong foundation in both front-end and back-end technologies, I thrive on creating seamless and dynamic web applications. My journey into web development began with a curiosity for how things work behind the scenes, and it quickly grew into a full-fledged passion. I enjoy tackling complex problems and turning ideas into reality through code.

In addition to my technical skills, I bring a creative perspective to my projects, thanks to my background in music. This unique combination allows me to approach challenges with a fresh and innovative mindset. Whether I'm composing a new piece of music or developing a new feature, I am driven by a desire to create and improve.

I am always eager to learn and stay updated with the latest industry trends and best practices. Collaboration and continuous improvement are at the heart of my work ethic. I believe in the power of teamwork and am always open to new opportunities to grow and contribute.

When I'm not coding or playing music, you can find me exploring the outdoors, experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen, or spending quality time with family and friends. I am excited to connect with like-minded individuals and explore new opportunities in the tech world.
